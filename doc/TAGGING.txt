                           Routino : Tagging Rules
                           =======================


   The different tags and attributes in the OSM format XML that are used
   by Routino are described below.

   An important change for version 1.4 of Routino is that the tags in the
   input file are first processed according to a set of rules defined in a
   configuration file. This means that the information presented here is
   in two parts; firstly the tags that are recognised by Routino after
   pre-processing and secondly the transformations in the default
   configuration file.


Tags Recognised After Processing
--------------------------------

   This section describes the tags that are recognised by Routino after
   the tag transformations have been applied. This is therefore a much
   reduced set of tags compared to the original OSM data and also includes
   tags which are specific to Routino.

   In all cases of tag processing values of true, yes, 1 are recognised as
   being affirmative and any other value is ignored.


Node Tags And Attributes
------------------------

   None of the node tags are used but the node attributes id, latitude and
   longitude of the node. The id atribute is required to associate the
   node with the ways and the position attributes are required to locate
   the node.


Way Tags And Attributes
-----------------------

   The tags from the ways in the data are the ones that provide most of
   the information for routing. The id attribute is used only so that the
   many segments associated with a way can be share a set of tags taken
   from the way.

The highway Tag
- - - - - - - -

   The most important tag that is used from a way is the highway tag. This
   defines the type of highway that the way represents. Any way that does
   not have a highway tag is discarded.

   There are more highway types defined than are used by the router. The
   subset that the router uses are:
     * motorway
     * trunk
     * primary
     * secondary
     * tertiary
     * unclassified
     * residential
     * service
     * track
     * cycleway
     * path (1)
     * steps (2)

   Note 1: This changed in version 1.3 of Routino - the bridleway and
   footway types were included within the path highway type.
   Note 2: This changed in version 1.3 of Routino - the steps type was
   separated from the footway type.

Transport Specific Tags
- - - - - - - - - - - -

   One tag is recognised for each of the different modes of transport:
   foot, horse, bicycle, wheelchair, moped, motorbike, motorcar, goods,
   hgv and psv. These indicate whether the specific type of transport is
   allowed on the highway or not.

The name Tag
- - - - - -

   The name tag is used to provide the label for the highway when printing
   the results.

The ref Tag
- - - - - -

   The ref tag is used to provide the label for the highway when printing
   the results.

The junction Tag
- - - - - - - -

   The junction tag is used to check if a highway is (part of) a
   roundabout. This tag is used for information to label the highway if no
   other name is provided.

The multilane Tag
- - - - - - - - -

   The multilane tag is used to identify whether a highway has multiple
   lanes for traffic and this sets one of the highway properties. There is
   not normally a multilane tag but one needs to be added by the tag
   processing transformations. Values of true, yes, 1 are recognised.

The paved Tag
- - - - - - -

   The paved tag is used to identify whether a highway is paved or not,
   this is one of the available highway properties. A paved tag may exist
   in the original data but normally the surface tag needs to be
   transformed into the paved tag.

The bridge Tag
- - - - - - -

   The bridge tag is used to identify whether a highway is a bridge and
   therefore set one of the available properties.

The tunnel Tag
- - - - - - -

   The tunnel tag is used to identify whether a highway is a tunnel and
   therefore set one of the available properties.

The oneway Tag
- - - - - - -

   The oneway tag is used to specify that traffic is only allowed to
   travel in one direction.

The maxspeed Tag
- - - - - - - -

   The maxspeed tag is used to specify the maximum speed limit on the
   highway; this is always measured in km/hr in OpenStreetMap data. If the
   tag value contains "mph" then it is assumed to be a value in those
   units and converted to km/hr.

The maxweight Tag
- - - - - - - - -

   The maxweight tag is used to specify the maximum weight of any traffic
   on the way. In other words this must be set to the heaviest weight
   allowed on the way (for example a bridge) in tonnes. If the tag value
   contains "kg" then it is assumed that the value is in these units and
   converted to tonnes.

The maxheight Tag
- - - - - - - - -

   The maxheight tag is used to specify the maximum height of any traffic
   on the way. In other words this must be set to the lowest height of
   anything above the way (like a bridge) in metres. If the tag value
   contains a measurement in feet or feet and inches then attempts are
   made to convert this to metres.

The maxwidth Tag
- - - - - - - -

   The maxwidth tag is used to specify the maximum width of any traffic on
   the way. This must be set to the minimum width of the contraints at the
   wayside in metres. If the tag value contains a measurement in feet or
   feet and inches then attempts are made to convert this to metres.

The maxlength Tag
- - - - - - - - -

   The maxlength tag is used to specify the maximum length of any traffic
   on the way (usually from a traffic sign) in metres. If the tag value
   contains a measurement in feet or feet and inches then attempts are
   made to convert this to metres.


Relation Tags And Attributes
----------------------------

   Currently no relation tags or attributes are used.


Tag Transformations
-------------------

   This section describes the set of tag transformations that are
   contained in the default configuration file. The configuration file
   tagging rules are applied in sequence and this section of the document
   is arranged in the same order.


Node Tag Transformations
------------------------

   No transformations are applicable since no node tags are recognised.


Way Tag Transformations
-----------------------

Highway Defaults
- - - - - - - -

   The first part of the tag transformations is to decide on defaults for
   each type of highway. This uses the highway tag in the OSM file and
   maps it into one of the highway tags that are recognised by Routino,
   defining the default allowed transport types and adding a number of
   properties.

   The first part of the transformation is to convert the highway tag into
   one that is recognised by Routino.

   Original tag  Transformed tag
   ------------  ---------------
   bridleway     path
   byway         track
   footway       path
   living_street residential
   minor         unclassified
   pedestrian    path
   road          unclassified
   services      service
   unsurfaced    track
   unpaved       track
   walkway       path

   The type of highway also determines the defaults for the types of
   transport allowed on the highway. The default assumptions are as shown
   in the table below.

   Highway      foot horse  wheelchair bicycle moped motorbike motorcar goods hgv psv
   -------      ---- -----  ---------- ------- ----- --------- -------- ----- --- ---
   motorway     no   no     no         no      no    yes       yes      yes   yes yes
   trunk        no   no     no         yes     yes   yes       yes      yes   yes yes
   primary      yes  yes    yes        yes     yes   yes       yes      yes   yes yes
   secondary    yes  yes    yes        yes     yes   yes       yes      yes   yes yes
   tertiary     yes  yes    yes        yes     yes   yes       yes      yes   yes yes
   unclassified yes  yes    yes        yes     yes   yes       yes      yes   yes yes
   residential  yes  yes    yes        yes     yes   yes       yes      yes   yes yes
   service      yes  yes    yes        yes     yes   yes       yes      yes   yes yes
   track        yes  yes    yes        yes     no    no        no       no    no  no
   cycleway     yes  no     yes        yes     no    no        no       no    no  no
   path         yes  yes(1) yes        yes(1)  no    no        no       no    no  no
   steps        yes  no     yes        no      no    no        no       no    no  no

   Note 1: A path allows bicycle or horse access by default only if
   actually labelled as a highway of type "bridleway" or certain values of
   the designation tag (described below).

   Finally for the highway tag a number of properties are added depending
   on the highway type.

   Highway      Properties
   -------      ----------
   motorway     paved, oneway, multilane
   trunk        paved
   primary      paved
   secondary    paved
   tertiary     paved
   unclassified paved
   residential  paved
   service      paved
   track        paved (1)
   cycleway     paved
   path         paved (2)
   steps

   Note 1: A track is paved only if it is tagged as tracktype=grade1.
   Note 2: A path is paved only if it was originally tagged as
   highway=walkway or highway=pedestrian.

Generic Access Permissions
- - - - - - - - - - - - -

   The access tag is used to specify the default access restrictions on
   the way. If the tag value is "no" or "private" then all transport types
   are denied access (later tag transformation rules may add specific
   transport types back again).

Other Access Permissions
- - - - - - - - - - - -

   A tag named vehicle means any of the bicycle, moped, motorbike,
   motorcar, goods, hgv and psv transport types. A tag named motor_vehicle
   is transformed to mean any vehicle except a bicycle.

   The designation tag is used as an alternative method of identifying the
   legal right of way on a path (in the UK at least). The tag
   transformations convert these tags into a set of allowed transport
   types as shown below.

   Designation tag      Equivalent access permissions
   ---------------      -----------------------------
   bridleway or         foot=yes, wheelchair=yes, horse=yes,
     public_bridleway     bicycle=yes
   restricted_byway     foot=yes, wheelchair=yes, horse=yes,
                          bicycle=yes
   byway                foot=yes, wheelchair=yes, horse=yes,
                          bicycle=yes, moped=yes, motorbike=yes,
                          motorcar=yes
   footpath or          foot=yes, wheelchair=yes
     public_footpath

Specific Access Permissions
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   The final part of the access permissions is to use the specific
   transport type tags.

   One tag is recognised for each of the different modes of transport:
   foot, horse, bicycle, wheelchair, moped, motorbike, motorcar, goods,
   hgv and psv. These indicate whether the specific type of transport is
   allowed on the highway or not.

Highway Properties
- - - - - - - - -

   If there is a surface tag then the highway is assumed to be unpaved
   unless the tag value matches one of the following: paved, asphalt or
   concrete.

   Support for the obsolete paved tag is also provided and the highway is
   paved if this is set to a true value.

   The lanes tag is used to identify whether a highway has multiple lanes
   for traffic or not (the number of lanes is not important in this case,
   only whether it is more than one) this sets one of the highway
   properties.

   The bridge and tunnel tags are copied directly from the input to the
   output.

Highway Restrictions
- - - - - - - - - -

   The oneway, maxspeed, maxweight, maxheight, maxwidth and maxlength are
   copied directly from the input to the output without modification.

Highway Names and References
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   The name and ref tags are copied directly from the input to the output.


Relation Tag Transformations
----------------------------

   No transformations are applicable since no relation tags are recognised.
