                              Routino : Output
                              ================


   There are three different formats of output from the router, HTML, GPX
   (GPS eXchange) XML format and plain text with a total of five possible
   output files:
     * HTML route instructions for each interesting junction.
     * GPX track file containing every node.
     * GPX route file with waypoints at interesting junctions.
     * Plain text description with the interesting junctions.
     * Plain text file with every node.

   The "interesting junctions" referred to above are junctions where the
   route changes to a different type of highway, more than two highways of
   the same type meet, or where the route meets but does not take a more
   major highway. When the route follows a major road this definition
   eliminates all junctions with minor roads.

   The output files are written to the current directory and are named
   depending on the selection of shortest or quickest route. For the
   shortest route the file names are "shortest.html",
   "shortest-track.gpx", "shortest-route.gpx", "shortest.txt" and
   "shortest-all.txt", for the quickest route the names are
   "quickest.html", "quickest-track.gpx", "quickest-route.gpx",
   "quickest.txt" and "quickest-all.txt".

   The HTML file and GPX files are written out according to the selected
   language using the translations contained in the translations.xml
   configuration file.


HTML Route Instructions
-----------------------

   The HTML route instructions file contains one line for each of the
   interesting junctions in the route and one line for the highway that
   connects them.

   An example HTML file output is below (some parts are missing, for
   example the style definitions):

   The coordinates are included in the file but are not visible because of
   the style definitions.


GPX Track File
--------------

   The GPX track file contains a track with all of the individual nodes
   that the route passes through.

   An example GPX track file output is below:

GPX Route File
--------------

   The GPX route file contains a route (ordered set of waypoints) with all
   of the interesting junctions that the route passes through.

   An example GPX route file output is below:

Text File
---------

   The text file format contains one entry for all of the interesting
   junctions in the route and is intended to be easy to interpret.

   An example text file output is below:

# Creator : Routino - http://www.routino.org/
# Source : Based on OpenStreetMap data from http://www.openstreetmap.org/
# License : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/

 51.478353        -0.103561      0.598 km        0.4 min          6.2 km   5 min        Junct    +2      -3     Camberwell New Road (A202)

   The text file output contains a header (indicated by the lines starting
   with '#') and then one line for each junction. Each line contains the
   information for the route up to that point and the direction to go
   next. For each of the lines the individual fields contain the
   following:

   Latitude - Location of the point (degrees)

   Longitude - Location of the point (degrees)

   Section Distance - The distance travelled on the section of the journey
   that ends at this point (defined on this line).

   Section Duration - The duration of travel on the section of the journey
   that ends at this point (defined on this line).

   Total Distance - The total distance travelled up to this point.

   Total Duration - The total duration of travel up to this point.

   Point Type - The type of point; either a waypoint Waypt or junction
   Junct.

   Turn - The direction to turn at this point (missing for the first point
   since the journey has not started yet and the last point because it has
   finished). This can take one of nine values between -4 and +4 defined
   by: 0 = Straight, +2 = Right, -2 = Left and +/-4 = Reverse.

   Bearing - The direction to head at this point (missing for the last point
   since the journey has finished). This can take one of nine values
   between -4 and +4 defined by: 0 = North, +2 = East, -2 = West and +/-4
   = South.

   Highway - The name (or description) of the highway to follow (missing on
   the first line).

   The individual items are separated by tabs but some of the items
   contain spaces as well.


All Nodes Text File
-------------------

   The all nodes text file format contains one entry for each of the nodes
   on the route.

   An example all nodes text file output is below:

# Creator : Routino - http://www.routino.org/
# Source : Based on OpenStreetMap data from http://www.openstreetmap.org/
# License : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/

   The all nodes text file output is similar to the text file output
   except that a line is printed for each of the nodes rather than just
   the interesting junctions. For each of the lines the individual fields
   contain the following:

   Latitude - Location of the point in degrees.

   Longitude - Location of the point in degrees.

   Node - The internal node number and an indicator "*" if the node is a
   super-node.

   Type - The type of point; a waypoint Waypt, junction Junct, change of
   highway Change or intermediate node Inter.

   Segment Distance - The distance travelled on the segment defined on this
   line.

   Segment Duration - The duration of travel on the segment defined on this
   line.

   Total Distance - The total distance travelled up to this point.

   Total Duration - The total duration of travel up to this point.

   Speed - The speed of travel on the segment defined on this line (missing
   on the first line).

   Bearing - The direction that the segment defined on this line travels in
   degrees (missing on the first line).

   Highway - The name (or description) of the highway segment (missing on
   the first line).
