<h2><a name="H_1_1"></a>Tags And Attributes</h2>

The different tags and attributes in the 
<a class="ext" title="OpenStreetMap" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OSM</a>
format XML that are used by Routino are described below.

<p>

An important change for version 1.4 of Routino is that the tags in the input
file are first processed according to a set of rules defined in a configuration
file.  This means that the information presented here is in two parts; firstly
the tags that are recognised by Routino after pre-processing and secondly the
transformations in the default configuration file.


<h2><a name="H_1_2" title="After Processing"></a>Tags Recognised After Processing</h2>

This section describes the tags that are recognised by Routino after the tag
transformations have been applied.  This is therefore a much reduced set of tags
compared to the original OSM data and also includes tags which are specific to
Routino.

<p>

In all cases of tag processing values of <em>true</em>, <em>yes</em>, <em>1</em>
are recognised as being affirmative and any other value is ignored.


<h3><a name="H_1_2_1" title="Nodes"></a>Node Tags And Attributes</h3>

None of the node tags are used but the node attributes <em>id</em>, <em>latitude</em>
and <em>longitude</em> of the node.  The id atribute is required to associate the
node with the ways and the position attributes are required to locate the node.


<h3><a name="H_1_2_2" title="Ways"></a>Way Tags And Attributes</h3>

The tags from the ways in the data are the ones that provide most of the
information for routing.  The <em>id</em> attribute is used only so that the
many segments associated with a way can be share a set of tags taken from the
way.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_1" title="highway"></a>The highway Tag</h4>

The most important tag that is used from a way is the <em>highway</em> tag.
This defines the type of highway that the way represents.  Any way that does not
have a highway tag is discarded.

<p>

There are more highway types defined than are used by the router.  The subset
that the router uses are:

<ul>
  <li>motorway
  <li>trunk
  <li>primary
  <li>secondary
  <li>tertiary
  <li>unclassified
  <li>residential
  <li>service
  <li>track
  <li>cycleway
  <li>path (1)
  <li>steps (2)
</ul>

<p>

<i>
  Note 1: This changed in version 1.3 of Routino - the bridleway and footway
  types were included within the path highway type.
  <br>
  Note 2: This changed in version 1.3 of Routino - the steps type was separated
  from the footway type.
</i>


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_2" title="transport tags"></a>Transport Specific Tags</h4>

One tag is recognised for each of the different modes of transport: <em>foot</em>,
<em>horse</em>, <em>bicycle</em>, <em>wheelchair</em>, <em>moped</em>,
<em>motorbike</em>, <em>motorcar</em>, <em>goods</em>, <em>hgv</em>
and <em>psv</em>.  These indicate whether the specific type of transport is
allowed on the highway or not.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_3" title="name"></a>The name Tag</h4>

The <em>name</em> tag is used to provide the label for the highway when printing
the results.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_4" title="ref"></a>The ref Tag</h4>

The <em>ref</em> tag is used to provide the label for the highway when printing
the results.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_5" title="junction"></a>The junction Tag</h4>

The <em>junction</em> tag is used to check if a highway is (part of) a
roundabout.  This tag is used for information to label the highway if no other
name is provided.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_6" title="multilane"></a>The multilane Tag</h4>

The <em>multilane</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway has multiple
lanes for traffic and this sets one of the highway properties.  There is not
normally a <em>multilane</em> tag but one needs to be added by the tag
processing transformations.  Values of <em>true</em>, <em>yes</em>, <em>1</em>
are recognised.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_7" title="paved"></a>The paved Tag</h4>

The <em>paved</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway is paved or not,
this is one of the available highway properties.  A <em>paved</em> tag may exist
in the original data but normally the <em>surface</em> tag needs to be
transformed into the paved tag.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_8" title="bridge"></a>The bridge Tag</h4>

The <em>bridge</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway is a bridge and
therefore set one of the available properties.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_9" title="tunnel"></a>The tunnel Tag</h4>

The <em>tunnel</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway is a tunnel and
therefore set one of the available properties.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_10" title="oneway"></a>The oneway Tag</h4>

The <em>oneway</em> tag is used to specify that traffic is only allowed to
travel in one direction.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_11" title="maxspeed"></a>The maxspeed Tag</h4>

The <em>maxspeed</em> tag is used to specify the maximum speed limit on the
highway; this is always measured in km/hr in OpenStreetMap data.  If the tag
value contains "mph" then it is assumed to be a value in those units and
converted to km/hr.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_12" title="maxweight"></a>The maxweight Tag</h4>

The <em>maxweight</em> tag is used to specify the maximum weight of any traffic
on the way.  In other words this must be set to the heaviest weight allowed on
the way (for example a bridge) in tonnes.  If the tag value contains "kg" then
it is assumed that the value is in these units and converted to tonnes.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_13" title="maxheight"></a>The maxheight Tag</h4>

The <em>maxheight</em> tag is used to specify the maximum height of any traffic
on the way.  In other words this must be set to the lowest height of anything
above the way (like a bridge) in metres.  If the tag value contains a
measurement in feet or feet and inches then attempts are made to convert this to
metres.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_14" title="maxwidth"></a>The maxwidth Tag</h4>

The <em>maxwidth</em> tag is used to specify the maximum width of any traffic on
the way.  This must be set to the minimum width of the contraints at the wayside
in metres.  If the tag value contains a measurement in feet or feet and inches
then attempts are made to convert this to metres.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_15" title="maxlength"></a>The maxlength Tag</h4>

The <em>maxlength</em> tag is used to specify the maximum length of any traffic
on the way (usually from a traffic sign) in metres.  If the tag value contains a
measurement in feet or feet and inches then attempts are made to convert this to
metres.


<h3><a name="H_1_2_3" title="Relations"></a>Relation Tags And Attributes</h3>

Currently no relation tags or attributes are used.


<h2><a name="H_1_3" title="Tag Transformations"></a>Tag Transformations</h2>

This section describes the set of tag transformations that are contained in the
default configuration file.  The configuration file tagging rules are applied in
sequence and this section of the document is arranged in the same order.


<h3><a name="H_1_3_1" title="Nodes"></a>Node Tag Transformations</h3>

No transformations are applicable since no node tags are recognised.


<h3><a name="H_1_3_2" title="Ways"></a>Way Tag Transformations</h3>


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_1" title="Highway Defaults"></a>Highway Defaults</h4>

The first part of the tag transformations is to decide on defaults for each type
of highway.  This uses the highway tag in the OSM file and maps it into one of
the highway tags that are recognised by Routino, defining the default allowed
transport types and adding a number of properties.

<p>

The first part of the transformation is to convert the highway tag into one that
is recognised by Routino.

The type of highway also determines the defaults for the types of transport
allowed on the highway.  The default assumptions are as shown in the table
below.

  Note 1: A path allows bicycle or horse access by default only if actually
  labelled as a highway of type "bridleway" or certain values of
  the <em>designation</em> tag (described below).

<p>

Finally for the highway tag a number of properties are added depending on the
highway type.

  Note 1: A track is paved only if it is tagged as tracktype=grade1.

</i>


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_2" title="Generic access"></a>Generic Access Permissions</h4>

The <em>access</em> tag is used to specify the default access restrictions on
the way.  If the tag value is "no" or "private" then all transport types are
denied access (later tag transformation rules may add specific transport types
back again).


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_3" title="Other access"></a>Other Access Permissions</h4>

A tag named <em>vehicle</em> means any of the <em>bicycle</em>, <em>moped</em>,
<em>motorbike</em>, <em>motorcar</em>, <em>goods</em>, <em>hgv</em>
and <em>psv</em> transport types.  A tag named <em>motor_vehicle</em> is
transformed to mean any vehicle except a <em>bicycle</em>.

<p>

The <em>designation</em> tag is used as an alternative method of identifying the
legal right of way on a path (in the UK at least).  The tag transformations
convert these tags into a set of allowed transport types as shown below.

<p>

<table>
  <caption>Aliasing of designation types</caption>
  <tr>
    <th class="left">Designation tag
    <th class="left">Equivalent access permissions
  <tr>
    <td class="left">bridleway or public_bridleway
    <td class="left">foot=yes, wheelchair=yes, horse=yes, bicycle=yes
  <tr>
    <td class="left">restricted_byway
    <td class="left">foot=yes, wheelchair=yes, horse=yes, bicycle=yes
  <tr>
    <td class="left">byway
    <td class="left">foot=yes, wheelchair=yes, horse=yes, bicycle=yes, moped=yes, motorbike=yes, motorcar=yes
  <tr>
    <td class="left">footpath or public_footpath
    <td class="left">foot=yes, wheelchair=yes
</table>


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_4" title="Specific access"></a>Specific Access Permissions</h4>

The final part of the access permissions is to use the specific transport type
tags.

<p>

One tag is recognised for each of the different modes of transport: <em>foot</em>,
<em>horse</em>, <em>bicycle</em>, <em>wheelchair</em>, <em>moped</em>,
<em>motorbike</em>, <em>motorcar</em>, <em>goods</em>, <em>hgv</em>
and <em>psv</em>.  These indicate whether the specific type of transport is
allowed on the highway or not.


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_5" title="Properties"></a>Highway Properties</h4>

If there is a surface tag then the highway is assumed to be unpaved unless the
tag value matches one of the following: <em>paved</em>, <em>asphalt</em>
or <em>concrete</em>.

<p>

Support for the obsolete <em>paved</em> tag is also provided and the highway is
paved if this is set to a true value.

<p>

The <em>lanes</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway has multiple lanes
for traffic or not (the number of lanes is not important in this case, only
whether it is more than one) this sets one of the highway properties.

<p>

The <em>bridge</em> and <em>tunnel</em> tags are copied directly from the input
to the output.


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_6" title="Restrictions"></a>Highway Restrictions</h4>

The <em>oneway</em>, <em>maxspeed</em>, <em>maxweight</em>, <em>maxheight</em>,
<em>maxwidth</em> and <em>maxlength</em> are copied directly from the input to
the output without modification.


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_7" title="Names and Refs"></a>Highway Names and References</h4>

The <em>name</em> and <em>ref</em> tags are copied directly from the input to
the output.


<h3><a name="H_1_3_3" title="Relations"></a>Relation Tag Transformations</h3>

No transformations are applicable since no relation tags are recognised.
