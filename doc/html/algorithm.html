<h2><a name="H_1_1"></a>Algorithms</h2>

This page describes the development of the algorithm that is used in Routino for
finding routes.

<h3><a name="H_1_1_1"></a>Simplest Algorithm</h3>

The algorithm to find a route is fundamentally simple: Start at the beginning,
follow all possible routes and keep going until you reach the end.
<p>
While this method does work, it isn't fast.  To be able to find a route quickly
needs a different algorithm, one that can find the correct answer without
wasting time on routes that lead nowhere.

<h3><a name="H_1_1_2"></a>Improved Algorithm</h3>

The simplest way to do this is to follow all possible segments from the starting
node to the next nearest node (an intermediate node in the complete journey).
For each node that is reached store the shortest route from the starting node
and the length of that route.  The list of intermediate nodes needs to be
maintained in order of shortest overall route on the assumption that there is a
straight line route from here to the end node.
<br>
At each point the intermediate node that has the shortest potential overall
journey time is processed before any other node.  From the first node in the
list follow all possible segments and place the newly discovered nodes into the
same list ordered in the same way.  This will tend to constrain the list of
nodes examined to be the ones that are between the start and end nodes.  If at
any point you reach a node that has already been reached by a longer route then
you can discard that route since the newly discovered route is shorter.
Conversely if the previously discovered route is shorter then discard the new
route.
<br>
At some point the end node will be reached and then any routes with potential
lengths longer than this actual route can be immediately discarded.  The few
remaining potential routes must be continued until they are found to be shorter
or have no possibility of being shorter.  The shortest possible route is then
found.
<p>
At all times when looking at a node only those segments that are possible by the
chosen means of transport are followed.  This allows the type of transport to be
handled easily.  When finding the quickest route the same rules apply except
that criterion for sorting is the shortest potential route (assuming that from
each node to the end is the fastest possible type of highway).
<p>
This method also works, but again it isn't very fast.  The problem is that the
complexity is proportional to the number of nodes or segments in all routes
examined between the start and end nodes.  Maintaining the list of intermediate
nodes in order is the most complex part.

<h3><a name="H_1_1_3"></a>Final Algorithm</h3>

The final algorithm that is implemented in the router is basically the one above
but with an important difference.  Instead of finding a long route among a data
set of 8,000,000 nodes (number of highway nodes in UK at beginning of 2010) it
finds one long route in a data set of 1,000,000 nodes and a few hundred very
short routes in the full data set.  Since the time taken to find a route is
proportional to the number of nodes the main route takes 1/10th of the time and
the very short routes take almost no time at all.
<p>
The solution to making the algorithm fast is therefore to discard most of the
nodes and only keep the interesting ones.  In this case a node is deemed to be
interesting if it is the junction of two segments with different properties.  In
the algorithm these are classed as <em>super-nodes</em>.  Starting at each
super-node a <em>super-segment</em> is generated that finishes on another
super-node and contains the <em>shortest</em> path along segments with identical
properties (and these properties are inherited by the super-segment).  The point
of choosing the shortest route is that since all segments considered have
identical properties they will be treated identically when properties are taken
into account.  This decision making process can be repeated until the only the
most important and interesting nodes remain.
<p>
<img alt="Original data" src="example0.png"><br>
<img alt="Iteration 1" src="example1.png"><br>
<img alt="Iteration 2" src="example2.png"><br>
<p>
To find a route between a start and finish point now comprises the following
steps (assuming a shortest route is required):
<ol>
  <li>Find all shortest routes from the start point along normal segments and
  stopping when super-nodes are reached.
  <li>Find all shortest routes from the end point backwards along normal
  segments and stopping when super-nodes are reached.
  <li>Find the shortest route along super-segments from the set of super-nodes
  in step 1 to the set of super-nodes in step 2 (taking into account the lengths
  found in steps 1 and 2 between the start/finish super-nodes and the ultimate
  start/finish point).
  <li>For each super-segment in step 3 find the shortest route between the two
  end-point super-nodes.
</ol>
This multi-step process is considerably quicker than using all nodes but gives a
result that still contains the full list of nodes that are visited.  There are
some special cases though, for example very short routes that do not pass
through any super-nodes, or routes that start or finish on a super-node.  In
these cases one or more of the steps listed can be removed or simplified.

<h3><a name="H_1_1_4"></a>Routing Preferences</h3>

One of the important features of Routino is the ability to select a route that
is optimum for a set of criteria such as preferences for each type of highway,
speed limits and other restrictions and highway properties.
<p>
All of these features are handled by assigning a score to each segment while
calculating the route and trying to minimise the score rather than simply
minimising the length.
<dl>
  <dt>Segment length
  <dd>When calculating the shortest route the length of the segment is the
  starting point for the score.
  <dt>Speed preference
  <dd>When calculating the quickest route the time taken calculated from the
  length of the segment and the lower of the highway's own speed limit and the
  user's speed preference for the type of highway is the starting point for the
  score.
  <dt>Oneway restriction
  <dd>If a highway has the oneway property in the opposite direction to the
  desired travel and the user's preference is to obey oneway restrictions then
  the segment is ignored.
  <dt>Weight, height, width &amp; length limits
  <dd>If a highway has one of these limits and its value is less than the user's
  specified requirement then the segment is ignored.
  <dt>Highway preference
  <dd>The highway preference specified by the user is a percentage, these are
  scaled so that the most preferred highway type has a weighted preference of
  1.0 (0% always has a weighted preference of 0.0).  The calculated score for a
  segment is divided by this weighted preference.
  <dt>Highway properties
  <dd>The other highway properties are specified by the user as a percentage and
  each highway either has that property or not.  The user's property preference
  is scaled into the range 0.0 (for 0%) to 2.0 (for 100%) to give a weighted
  preference, a second "non-property" weighted preference is calcuated in the
  same way after subtracting the user's preference from 100%.  If a segment has
  this property then the calculated score is divided by the weighted preference,
  if the segment does not have this property then it is divided by the
  non-property weighted preference.
</dl>

<h3><a name="H_1_1_5"></a>Implementation</h3>

The hardest part of implementing this router is the data organisation.  The
arrangement of the data to minimise the number of operations required to follow
a route from one node to another is much harder than designing the algorithm
itself.
<p>
The final implementation uses a separate table for nodes, segments and ways.
Each table individually is implemented as a C-language data structure that is
written to disk by a program which parses the OpenStreetMap XML data file.  In
the router these data structures are memory mapped so that the operating system
handles the problems of loading the needed data blocks from disk.
<p>
Each node contains a latitude and longitude and they are sorted geographically
so that converting a latitude and longitude coordinate to a node is fast as well
as looking up the coordinate of a node.  The node also contains the location in
the array of segments for the first segment that uses that node.
<br>
Each segment contains the location of the two nodes as well as the way that the
segment came from.  The location of the next segment that uses one of the two
nodes is also stored; the next segment for the other node is the following one
in the array.  The length of the segment is also pre-computed and stored.
<br>
Each way has a name, a highway type, a list of allowed types of traffic, a speed
limit, any weight, height, width or length restrictions and the highway
properties.
<p>
The super-nodes are mixed in with the nodes and the super-segments are mixed in
with the segments.  For the nodes they are the same as the normal nodes, so just
a flag is needed to indicate that they are super.  The super-segments are in
addition to the normal segments so they increase the database size (by about
10%) and are also marked with a flag.

<h3><a name="H_1_1_6"></a>Practicalities</h3>

At the time of writing (April 2010) the OpenStreetMap data for Great Britain
(taken from
<a class="ext" href="http://download.geofabrik.de/osm/europe/" title="GeoFabrik Mirror of OpenStreetMap Data">GeoFabrik</a>
) contains:
<ul>
  <li>14,675,098 nodes
  <ul>
    <li>8,767,521 are highway nodes
    <li>1,120,297 are super-nodes
  </ul>
  <li>1,876,822 ways
  <ul>
    <li>1,412,898 are highways
    <ul>
      <li>9,316,328 highway segments
      <li>1,641,009 are super-segments
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>60,572 relations
</ul>

The database files when generated are 41.5 MB for nodes, 121.6 MB for segments
and 12.6 MB for ways and are stored uncompressed.  By having at least 200 MB or
RAM available the routing can be performed with no disk accesses (once the data
has been read once).
