                  Routino : OpenStreetMap Routing Software
                  ========================================


   Routino is an application for finding a route between two points using
   the dataset of topographical information collected by
   http://www.OpenStreetMap.org.

   Starting from the raw OpenStreetMap data (in the form of the '.osm' XML
   files available on the internet) a custom database is generated that
   contains the information useful for routing. With this database and two
   points specified by latitude and longitude an optimum route (either
   shortest or quickest) is determined. The route is calculated for
   OpenStreetMap highways (roads, paths etc) using one of the common forms
   of transport defined in OpenStreetMap (foot, bicycle, horse, motorcar,
   motorbike etc).

   When processing the OpenStreetMap data the types of highways are
   recorded and these set default limits on the types of traffic allowed.
   More specific information about permissions for different types of
   transport are also recorded as are maximum speed limits. Further
   restrictions like oneway streets, weight, height, width and length
   limits are also included where specified. Additionally a set of
   properties of each highway are also recorded. The processing of the
   input file is controlled by a configuration file which determines the
   information that is used.

   When calculating a route the type of transport to be used is taken into
   account to ensure that the known restrictions are followed. Each of the
   different highway types can further be allowed or disallowed depending
   on preferences. For each type of highway a default speed limit is
   defined (although the actual speed used will be the lowest of the
   default and any specified in the original data). To make use of the
   information about restrictions the weight, height, width and length of
   the transport can also be specified. Further preferences about road
   properties (e.g. paved or not) can also be selected.

   The result of calculating the route can be presented in several
   different ways. An HTML file can be produced that contains a
   description of the route to take with instructions for each of the
   important junctions. The contents of the file are created based on a
   set of translations specified in a configuration file. The route is
   also available in a GPX (GPS eXchange) XML format. format file
   containing either every point and highway segment (a track file) or
   just a waypoint and translated instructions for the important junctions
   (a route file). Additionally there are two plain text files that
   contain all data points or just the important ones (intended for
   debugging and further processing).

   One of the design aims of Routino was to make the software are flexible
   as possible in selecting routing preferences but also have a sensible
   set of default values. Another design aim was that finding the optimum
   route should be very fast and most of the speed increases come from the
   carefully chosen and optimised data format.


Disclaimer
----------

   The route that is calculated by this software is only as good as the
   input data.

   Routino comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY for the software itself or
   the route that is calculated by it.


Demonstration
-------------

   A live demonstration of the router for the UK is available on the
   internet:

   http://www.routino.org/uk/router.html

   The source code download available also includes a set of files that can
   be used to create your own interactive map.

   The interactive map is made possible by use of the OpenLayers Javascript
   library from http://www.openlayers.org/.


Documentation
-------------

   The algorithm used is described in the file ALGORITHM.txt and some
   notes about the limitations of the data is in DATA.txt.

   The configuration files and in particular the default set of rules for
   processing the OpenStreetMap data tags are described in detail in
   CONFIGURATION.txt and TAGGING.txt.  The format of the output files
   generated are described in OUTPUT.txt.

   Detailed information about how to use the programs is available in the
   file USAGE.txt and how to install it is in INSTALL.txt.
